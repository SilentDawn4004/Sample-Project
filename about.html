<h1>About</h1>
<p>TwitchCon is a biannual convention for the live streaming video platform,
 Twitch, devoted to Twitch and the culture of video game streaming/gaming on-demand.
 For streamers, it gives them an opportunity to seek improvements for their streams 
 and grow their brand. It also provides fans with a unique chance to meet streamers,
 play new games, and meet with online communities in real life. The first convention
 was held in 2015. Through 2018, they have been all held at various convention centers
 in California, until TwitchCon Europe was announced. The most recent convention was
 held on September 27-29, 2019 at the San Diego Convention Center. TwitchCon is hosted
 2 times a year, once in North America, as a 3-day-long event, and once in Europe,
 as a 2-day-long event.
